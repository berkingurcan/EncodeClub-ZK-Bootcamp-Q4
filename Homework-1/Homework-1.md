### Maths Introduction

1) Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

- 4 + 4 = 1
- 3 x 5 = 1
- The inverse of 3 = 4 for addition, 5 for multiplication

2) For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

```
To be considered a group this combination needs to have certain
properties

- Closure
- Associativity
- Inverse Element
- Identity Element
```

When we consider S and addition operation '+' corresponding properties above, it is group.

3) -13 mod 5 = 2
4) For the polynomial x<sup>3</sup>−x<sup>2</sup> + 4x − 12
- The positive root is 2
- The degree of this polynomial is 3
